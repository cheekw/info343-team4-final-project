                <p className="mx-3 barlow">Udon noodles are a traditional and very popular wheat-flour noodle eaten across Japan, dating back to the 9th Century. A famous Buddhist monk named Kūkai is often credited with bringing the noodle-making techniques from China, which were later adopted and popularized in the Sanuki Province of the island of Shikoku, Japan. In present times, that same area is known as Kagawa Prefecture, the smallest prefecture in Japan, and yet there are approximately 700 Sanuki udon shops in Kagawa alone! Although there are many regional varieties of udon noodles across Japan, Sanuki-style, characterized by a broad, thick noodle with a chewy texture, is the most popular.</p>
                <p className="mx-3 barlow">At <strong>U:Don Fresh Japanese Noodle Station</strong> (pronounced “You-Don”), we want you, our valued guest, to experience the superior taste and texture of freshly made Sanuki-style udon noodles, as if you were eating them in an udon shop in Japan.
