## Description
Our team is trying to build/rebuild a website for a local restaurant, U:Don, on University Avenue. The current website provided by U:Don is not mobile friendly, so we want to help rebuild their website to provide a cleaner and more responsive interface on both mobile and desktop mediums. Their website is also designed by WordPress and has cookie-cutter qualities of a WordPress theme. By recreating their website,we want to create a unique design to attract more users to their online website.
