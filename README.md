## Description
Our team is trying to rebuild a website for a local restaurant, U:Don. U:Don's current website is not mobile friendly, outdated and inelegant, so we want to help U:Don build a website that is clean and more responsive on both mobile and desktop mediums. Along the way, we want to help U:Don transition from using WordPress to our own custom built solution. Our solution will add a host of functionality for users such as the ability to favorite menu items, online ordering and basic account settings. Not only that, it also provides tools for admin users such as dynamic menu creation, analytics for popular items on the menu, etc.
